For this application user is asked a series of questions that will help them build a professional README.md

User will be asked for title of their project

and this will be displayed as the title of the README

Then there's a series of questions who's answers will be added to the sections title: Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

User is also able to choose a license for their application which then displays a badge near the top of the README and gives a link under license section for details on the chosen lisence. 

At the bottom of the read me theres a section for question, user is asked to enter github username, and email address.
