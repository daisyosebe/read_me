## README
## Description:
```
For this application, the user is asked a series of questions that will help them build a professional README.md

User will be asked for the title of their project

and this will be displayed as the title of the README

Then there's a series of questions whose answers will be added to the sections titled: Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

User can also choose a license for their application which then displays a badge near the top of the README and gives a link under the license section for details on the selected license. 

At the bottom of the README there's a section for questions, the user is asked to enter a GitHub username and email address.
